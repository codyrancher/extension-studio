// The chord that opens the agent, from anywhere in Rancher.
//
// This bundle is a UIPlugin, so index.ts runs on every page load of the whole dashboard - the
// Studio's screens, Rancher's own, a cluster's Workloads list. That is already a global hook,
// and it is the only one needed: a keydown listener on the document, and a panel appended to
// the body. There is no slot to claim and nothing to register with, which is the point - the
// header's single NavHeaderRight slot is the mechanism this product deliberately gave up, since
// the last extension to claim it silently wins.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Who this is offered to, and why that is a decision rather than an omission.
//
// The pane runs as the `extension-studio` ServiceAccount, which is bound to cluster-admin. The
// exec WebSocket is authenticated as whoever is looking at the page, so Kubernetes refuses
// anybody without exec rights in this namespace - but exec in one namespace is not
// cluster-admin, and a user with edit on `extension-studio`, or a project containing it, has the
// first without the second. For them this chord is a one-keystroke privilege escalation, so the
// affordance is offered to Rancher admins only, and to everybody else it does not exist: no
// disabled button, no refusal, no hint that a chord is there. A control that only ever says no
// is noise.
//
// Say the honest thing about what that gate is: it is a UI gate, not a security boundary. A
// non-admin with exec rights in this namespace can still reach the pod with `kubectl`, and
// nothing in a browser can stop that. The real fix is to scope the pod's ServiceAccount below
// cluster-admin, and it is not done here because the agent's whole usefulness is that it can
// reach every extension pod and ask the cluster anything - a narrower grant is a design, not a
// smaller number.
