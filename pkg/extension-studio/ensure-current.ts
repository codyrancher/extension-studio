// Keeping an object in the cluster equal to the thing this bundle would create.

// `createIfAbsent` is the right rule for anything whose value is that it exists - a namespace, a
// ServiceAccount, the browser pod, whose replacement would throw away a live session. It is the
// wrong rule for anything whose value is its contents, and this product has two of those: the
// service's own source, and an extension's entry in the API registry.
//
// Both fail the same way when they are only ever created. A cluster keeps whatever it was first
// given, nothing anywhere reports a mismatch, and the source or the version being advertised
// stops being the one that is running. So an object that carries generated content records a
// fingerprint of that content, and is replaced when the fingerprint no longer matches.
