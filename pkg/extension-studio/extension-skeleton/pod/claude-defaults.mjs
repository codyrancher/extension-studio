// The settings a fresh claude stops and asks for, answered in advance.
//
// A pod is a fresh machine every time, so without this the first thing the
// editor's terminal shows is a theme picker, then a "do you trust this folder"
// dialog, then a "Yes, I accept" for bypass permissions - three questions whose
// answers are the same every time and none of which the person opening the
// editor is being asked anything real by. What they should land in is a prompt,
// or a login.
//
// Only the flags are set here. The login itself is pulled from a Kubernetes
// Secret before the pane starts (see claude-credentials.mjs); what this file
// adds for it is the Stop hook that pushes a refreshed token back, so the pod
// that happens to refresh does not leave every other pod on a stale one.
