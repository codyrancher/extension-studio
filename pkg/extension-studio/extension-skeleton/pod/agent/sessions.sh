# The conversations this pod is holding: list them, start one, rename one, end one.
#
# One script for four verbs, because all four rest on one fact that is easy to get wrong in four
# different ways: a conversation IS a directory under /workspace/sessions. Not a tmux session.
# tmux is where a conversation is currently *running*, and that is a different set - it is empty
# for the first minute after this pod restarts, while every conversation is still there on the
# hostPath with its transcript and its name intact, waiting to be reattached.
#
# Listing tmux instead was the first version and it had two bugs in it. Every conversation
# vanished from the strip when the pod rolled. And `new` could hand back a name whose directory
# still existed, so pressing + dropped you into somebody's finished conversation, because
# `tmux new-session -A` attaches to what is there - exactly right for reopening a tab and
# exactly wrong for asking for a new one.
#
# Run as the node user. A tmux server is per user and shell.sh starts every session as that
# user, so `kill-session` run as root would report no such session; and everything written here
# has to be writable by the pane that reads it.

# lose them. Beside the transcript rather than as the tmux session name, because the id names
# the directory, the tmux session AND the exec URL a pane opens - renaming it would mean the
# pane could no longer reattach to the conversation it is showing.

# It writes a line of its own into the transcript once it has enough to name it - the same title
# its resume picker lists - so the tab can say what the conversation is about rather than which
# number it was. The last one wins: claude renames a conversation as it goes.
