<script>
// The panel the global chord opens: several conversations with the agent pod, as tabs.
//
// Inside a tab is PodTerminal, unchanged, pointed at the agent pod instead of an extension's.
//
// Two things about the conversations, and they pull in opposite directions on purpose:
//
//   - Which conversations exist, and what they are called, come from the pod. tmux and a
//     directory under /workspace/sessions are where a conversation actually is, so that is what
//     is asked (see agent.ts), which is what makes a second browser tab, a reload and a
//     colleague's session all show the same list with the same names.
//   - Whether this panel is open, where it sits and how big it is come from localStorage. That
//     is one person in front of one browser, and putting it in the pod would mean docking the
//     panel left here docked it left on somebody else's screen. See agent-drawer.ts.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Why the tab row is written out here rather than imported.
//
// It is Rancher's `@shell/components/Tabbed` - its markup, its class names, its roles and its
// arrow-key behaviour - with two controls added to each tab. That component cannot express
// those, and the check is short: its label is rendered as escaped text (`{{ tab.labelDisplay }}`
// with no slot and no markup), and the one slot it has, `tab-row-extras`, is after the whole tab
// list. Its own add and remove controls live in a `tab-list-footer` at the end of the row and
// act on whichever tab happens to be active, which is exactly the arrangement being replaced: a
// person closing the third conversation should not have to select it first.
//
// So the row below is that row, kept deliberately recognisable, minus what a panel does not
// have: no `useHash` (this is not a route, and putting a conversation id in the URL would put it
// in Rancher's history), no side-tab mode, no extension tabs. Its styles are copied for the same
// reason - Tabbed's are `scoped`, so the class names alone inherit nothing.
//
// The one intended visual difference beyond the controls: the active tab is not accented.
// Rancher colours it `--active` and underlines it; here it reads as active through the underline
// and the weight alone, because an accent colour on a terminal's chrome fights the terminal.

// menu renders with `background: var(--studio-surface)` resolving to nothing and floats over the
