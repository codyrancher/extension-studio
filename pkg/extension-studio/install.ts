// What this extension installs, said once, in the order it is installed.

// happening was that the editor eventually worked. This is the same work as a list: what each
// object is, one sentence on why it exists, and where to go and look at it.
//
// The list is the source for three things that used to disagree - the install itself, the
// progress the editor shows, and the uninstall - so a resource added in one place cannot be
// forgotten by the other two.
