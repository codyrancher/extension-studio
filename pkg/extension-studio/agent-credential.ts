// Giving the agent pod the identity of whoever opened the terminal.
//
// The pod has a ServiceAccount, as every pod does, and it is the wrong credential in both
// directions. Rancher does not accept a Kubernetes ServiceAccount token at all - it resolves to
// `system:cattle:error` and answers 401 - so the Studio's own service, which forwards whatever
// its caller presented and holds nothing of its own, tells the agent it sent no credential. And
// where the ServiceAccount does work, straight at the apiserver, it works as cluster-admin:
// more than the person watching is likely to have, the same for everybody, and attributable to
// nobody afterwards.
//
// So the browser mints a Rancher API token as the signed-in user and leaves it in a Secret the
// pod reads at pane start. One token is the whole answer, because everything the agent might
// want is behind the same Rancher:
//
//   Rancher's own API          $RANCHER_URL/v1/..., /v3/...
//   Kubernetes                 $RANCHER_URL/k8s/clusters/local, as a kubeconfig
//   the Studio's service       http://extension-studio-api:8006 directly, in-cluster
//   a registered extension     $RANCHER_URL + the registry entry's url, which is a path on it
//
// The direct address for the service is not an optimisation. Rancher's proxy consumes the
// Authorization header on the way through - which is why the browser authenticates with the
// R_SESS cookie instead - so a token sent through the proxy arrives as no credential at all.
//
// Two things to be clear about rather than quiet about. This puts a named person's Rancher
// credential in a pod that any admin can exec into, and all panes run as one user, so it is not
// separated per conversation; the chord is already admin-only, which is what makes that a
// bounded rather than a new exposure. And a conversation outlives the panel, so a detached
// agent loses its credential when the token expires - which is the intended end of it, not a
// bug to work around.
