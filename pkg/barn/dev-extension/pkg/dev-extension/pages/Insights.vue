// Insights: what this person's agents have recorded, and a box to ask about it.
//
// It is one SQLite database per person rather than one per workspace, because the question it
// answers spans them: what have my agents been running into. It lives in dev-system beside the
// secret store, is created the first time this page is opened, and is written to over HTTP by
// anything in a workspace - `INSIGHTS_URL` is set on every workspace's pod, which is the same
// name the harness's own agents post to.
//
// Schema on write, so there is nothing to declare. An agent that posts a JSON object to
// `/api/insights/missing-tool` creates the table and the columns it implies, which is what lets a
// shell script in a conversation record something nobody planned for. See insights-server.ts.
//
// The query box is SELECT only, and that is enforced in the pod rather than here: a page can be
// edited from the console, and the thing holding the database is the only place a rule about it
// can actually hold.
