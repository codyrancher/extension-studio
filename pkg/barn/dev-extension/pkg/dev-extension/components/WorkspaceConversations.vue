// A workspace's conversations: a list down the left, the open one filling the rest.
//
// The harness gives a project many conversations rather than one terminal, and this is that. A
// conversation is claude in the workspace's own pod, numbered by the same function the drawer's
// terminals are numbered with, so the two cannot come to disagree about what the numbers mean.
//
// It is claude in every workspace and there is no other kind. It used to be a bare shell with a
// paragraph above it explaining that it was one; what was missing was never the install, which is
// seconds, but the two things around it, and both are now the workspace's own: the scripts are
// mounted at /seed (see ensureWorkspaceTerminal) and the template hands the tree to an ordinary
// user and installs the CLI on boot.
//
// Every conversation that has been opened stays mounted, hidden rather than destroyed, so
// switching between them keeps both alive. Closing one is what the row's delete does, and it is
// only the browser's end: the pane is a tmux session in the pod, so a conversation outlives the
// page and reopening the tab lands back in it.
