// Rancher's split button, composed here rather than imported.
//
// The shell ships one - `@components/RcButtonSplit` - and this is its markup, its class names
// and its stylesheet copied across. What it is not is its `<script setup>`, and that is the
// whole reason this file exists: that component takes its props as a TypeScript type that
// spreads `IconProps` imported from `@components/RcButton/types`, and `@vue/compiler-sfc` has
// to resolve that import itself to turn the type into runtime props. It resolves it against a
// tsconfig beside the file being compiled, which for a component inside `node_modules/@rancher/
// shell` is the shell's own - never this package's - so the alias is unknown and the build
// stops at "Failed to resolve import source". Adding the alias to our tsconfig does not help,
// for the same reason.
//
// Everything underneath is the shell's and is imported normally: those are value imports,
// which webpack resolves with the alias it already has. So this is Rancher's split button in
// every respect a person can see, assembled one level down from the wrapper that cannot
// compile in an extension.
