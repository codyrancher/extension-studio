// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Extensions: Rancher extensions whose dev servers run as pods in the cluster,
// and are edited inside those pods.
//
// A pod runs `vue-cli-service serve` over a whole dashboard with an extension
// package compiled into it. The browser reaches it through the Kubernetes
// apiserver's service proxy, on Rancher's own origin, so it is a second,
// live-reloading dashboard at a URL of its own, and Rancher's own UI and its
// `ui-dashboard-index` setting are left completely alone.
//
// There can be several. Each is a name, and that name is the whole of its
// identity: it decides the objects in the cluster, the directory on the node
// its tree lives in, and the URL it is served at. What one starts as is a
// choice: the stock package baked into this bundle, a repository to clone, or
// the live tree of an extension already running here.
//
// Everything an extension needs travels with this bundle: the source is written
// into a ConfigMap, the pod installs from it on first boot, and creating one is
// four objects. There is no install step and nothing to run outside the cluster.
//
// Editing is done in the pod. That tree is the live source once it has booted:
//   kubectl -n barn exec -it deploy/barn-<name>-extension \
//     -- bash -c 'cd "$(ls -d /app/pkg/*/ | head -1)" && exec bash'
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 * repository in the pod (see ensureExtensionRepo), so publishing it is adding a remote and
 * pushing, and what comes out is a repository somebody else can build from.
 *
 * It pushes source rather than a built bundle deliberately. A chart repository is built by the
 * receiving repository's own workflow from a tagged version - that is how barn itself is
 * published - and a bundle committed by hand would be the same artifact with no provenance.
 *
 * The token never reaches this page and never reaches the returned log: it is read straight
 * out of the Secret into the command, and scrubbed out of the output before it comes back. See
 * scrub below, which is not decoration - the log is shown in the UI when a publish fails.
 *
 * The repository is asked for at the point of publishing rather than configured beforehand,
 * because it is a decision about this push and not a property of the extension. It is
 * remembered afterwards so the next one only has to be agreed with, which is the difference
 * between a cache and a setting: the answer is kept, but the question is still asked.
